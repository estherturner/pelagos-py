@register_step
class FindProfilesStep(BaseStep, QCHandlingMixin):
    """
    Identifies and classifies vertical and horizontal profiles from depth-time data.

    The step smooths the depth (or pressure) record, derives vertical velocity from
    it, and uses that to label every measurement with a scientific phase. From those
    phases it then derives a continuous ``PROFILE_NUMBER``, a ``PROFILE_DIRECTION``,
    a ``CYCLE`` count, and ``PROFILE_GRADIENT`` (the smoothed vertical velocity used
    for classification, in depth units/s).

    **All parameters are optional** — every parameter has a sensible default, so the
    step runs unchanged on a typical OG1 dataset with no configuration at all (see the
    first example below).

    Phase definitions
    -----------------
    Phases follow the OceanGliders OG1 ``phase`` vocabulary [1]_ and are written to
    ``SCI_PHASE``. This step's scope:

    - **0 – unknown**: the default until reclassified below, and where it stays if
      nothing below applies.
    - **1 – ascent** / **2 – descent**: vertical velocity beyond ``velocity_threshold``,
      sustained for at least ``min_duration_seconds``. This pass runs first and always
      wins — nothing later ever overrides an ascent/descent classification.
    - **3 – surfacing**: whatever's left unknown near the surface (run median depth
      at or below ``surfacing_depth_threshold``) once ascent/descent is settled —
      covers both a flat/undulating stretch at the surface and the shoulder or apex
      of a turn that happens to be shallow.
    - **4 – parking** / **6 – propelled**: a flat, undulating stretch away from the
      surface, gated by the longer ``min_transect_duration_seconds`` so a turnaround
      (also briefly near-zero velocity) isn't mistaken for one. Which of the two it's
      labelled is controlled by ``transect_phase`` — parking is a passive drift,
      propelled means the platform is actually under thruster power (ALR-class).
    - **5 – inflection**: the single deepest/shallowest sample of a non-surface turn
      between a descent and an ascent (or vice versa, for a mid-water turn).
    - **7 – transition**: whatever's still unknown on the shoulder of a turn, between
      an inflection/surfacing point and the ascent/descent either side of it.

    A real data gap longer than ``gap_threshold_minutes`` splits the record into
    disconnected chunks: velocity is never computed, and no run ever allowed, across
    one — so e.g. an upcast whose data simply stops just before surfacing, with no
    matching downcast sampled, is still its own valid profile rather than being
    bridged into a false transition.

    Parameters
    ----------
    depth_column : str, optional
        Depth or pressure column used for the analysis. Default ``"PRES"``.
    smoothing_window_seconds : int, optional
        Rolling-mean window (seconds) applied to depth before differentiating, to
        keep sensor noise from flipping the sign of the velocity. Default ``30``.
    velocity_threshold : float, optional
        Vertical velocity (depth units/s) a smoothed sample must exceed to count as
        moving; below this, in either direction, it's unknown. Default ``0.033``.
    min_duration_seconds : int, optional
        A run of consistent ascent/descent (or of surfacing) shorter than this is
        too brief to trust and is folded back to unknown. Default ``60``.
    gap_threshold_minutes : int, optional
        A time gap longer than this splits the record into disconnected chunks.
        Default ``5``.
    surfacing_depth_threshold : float, optional
        Depth below which a propelled stretch, or the apex/shoulder of a turn, is
        classified surfacing instead — judged on run median depth. Default ``2.0``.
    min_transect_duration_seconds : int, optional
        Minimum duration for an unknown run to be classified parking/propelled.
        Deliberately much longer than ``min_duration_seconds``, since a turnaround
        also sits near-zero velocity for a few seconds but never for minutes.
        Default ``300``.
    transect_phase : {"auto", "parking", "propelled"}, optional
        Which phase a long, flat, non-surface "unknown" stretch is classified as.
        ``"parking"`` — passive drift, ``"propelled"`` — under thruster power
        (ALR-class platforms). ``"auto"`` looks for ``"ALR"`` in the source
        filename and picks ``"propelled"`` if found, else falls back to
        ``"parking"``. Default ``"auto"``.

    Examples
    --------
    The defaults are designed to work out of the box, so the simplest valid
    configuration sets no parameters at all:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        steps:
          - name: Find Profiles

    To tune the classification, any subset of parameters may be supplied. The block
    below lists every parameter set to its default value:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        steps:
          - name: Find Profiles
            parameters:
              depth_column: "PRES"
              smoothing_window_seconds: 30
              velocity_threshold: 0.033
              min_duration_seconds: 60
              gap_threshold_minutes: 5
              surfacing_depth_threshold: 2.0
