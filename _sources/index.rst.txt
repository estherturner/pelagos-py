Pelagos-Py documentation
========================

:Version: |release|

The NOC (National Oceanography Centre) Autonomy Toolbox, pelagos_py, is a modular processing pipeline tool designed to operate on raw
OG1-like format glider/ALR data, outputting "science ready" datasets. The user interfaces with the tool through a single YAML config file, allowing for easy definition and dissemination
of processing protocols. This allows academics to "standardise" their processing tools and easily share their methods by simply sharing raw data and config files.

As we hope this tool will be adopted by the glider community, effort has been made to implement a broad range of desirable processing steps, covering a large number of oceanographic
variables which continue to grow. We are always welcome to new suggestions and for those who want to get their hands dirty, we have attempted to make implementation of custom steps as
simple as possible. See :doc:`Development<development>` for more details.

Whilst the tool itself is written in python, interfacing with it requires little prior knowledge of the language. In most cases, processing is achieved through a few lines of code:

.. code-block:: python

   # Create the pipeline using the specified config
   Pipe = Pipeline(
      config_path=r"config.yaml"
   )
   Pipe.run()

The only involved part is defining your ``config.yaml`` which determines the details of how your raw data will be processed. YAML files are designed to be "human readable" so it should
be fairly intuitive to set them up. We have provided extensive details in ``examples/configs/all_step_configs.yaml`` which should help you - but if you see anything that doesn't
make sense, let us know so we can improve it.
